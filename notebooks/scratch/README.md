# Scratch Notebooks / Lab Notebook

This is a directory for keeping the experiments you tried out, your "scratch" work.  Try to start each notebook with a question you have (why are you opening a notebook) and end each notebook with a copy of useful code snippets you discovered that you might like to reuse.
